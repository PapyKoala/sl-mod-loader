Hell yeah we got SL mod loader before GTA VI

Just use either normal or colorless, it just depends of your cmd, some just can't display the the ANSI colors I've used, and they display as ulgy codes

the .slmod template is made for modders that want to make their mods work with the modloader (thx if you do)

I'll soon update my mods to .slmod on the SL page of gamebanana
